This supplemental document provides blending results for this paper entitled 'Avoiding bleeding in image
blending'. This supplemental material consists three parts including the MATLAB version of the source code,
several image results and several video results. The MATLAB code  is tested on MATLAB 2014a. The directory 
'Images' includes our image results, including unblended image,result of convolution pyramid blending and
result of our proposed method.The directory 'Videos' consists  of blended videos of two scenes, each consisting of 
the result of  convolution pyramid blending and our proposed method.
